## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial scaffold: a Cargo workspace for an agentic coding harness driving
  OpenAI-compatible models.
- `hrdr-llm`: provider-agnostic `/v1/chat/completions` client with SSE streaming
  and tool-call reassembly (`Accumulator`).
- `hrdr-tools`: the locked MVP tool set — `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit`,
  `bash`, `grep`, `glob`, `todo_write` — with a registry and token-bounded
  outputs.
- `hrdr-agent`: the tool-calling agent loop with a minijinja system prompt.
- `hrdr-editor`: FSM-agnostic `EditorEngine` seam embedding the hjkl vim engine,
  projected from hjkl's `CoarseMode` so future disciplines plug in without churn.
- `hrdr-tui`: ratatui UI with a streaming transcript and a vim-keybound input
  pane.
- `hrdr` binary: interactive TUI by default, `hrdr run <task>` for headless,
  scriptable single-turn runs.
